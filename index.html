<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology used for designing and formatting web pages.
    It works hand in hand with HTML and JavaScript to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
    CSS enables developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page, separating the content from its presentation.
    This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and update websites, as changes can be applied globally through CSS rules.
    One of the key concepts in CSS is the cascading nature of styles. Styles can be defined in multiple places (inline, internal, or external stylesheets), and they cascade down to affect the appearance of elements on the page.
    This allows for greater flexibility and specificity in styling, as developers can override or inherit styles as needed.
    Selectors are another important aspect of CSS, allowing developers to target specific elements on the page and apply styles to them. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, and even relationships between elements.
    CSS has evolved significantly over the years, with the introduction of new features like flexbox and grid layouts, which make it easier to create complex and responsive designs.
    Additionally, preprocessors like SASS and LESS extend the capabilities of CSS by adding variables, mixins, and other programming-like features. Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for web development, enabling developers to create beautiful and functional websites that delight users and enhance their browsing experience.
